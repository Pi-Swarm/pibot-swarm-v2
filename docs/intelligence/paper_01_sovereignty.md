## 🏗️ Abstract
Traditional security tools are reactive and static. In the era of Web3 and decentralized finance, security must be **autonomous, proactive, and sovereign**. This paper introduces the **Pi Swarm Architecture**—a multi-agent system designed to secure digital ecosystems without human bottlenecks.

## 🧠 The Swarm Intelligence Model
Unlike monolithic AI models, the Pi Swarm operates through five specialized nodes:
- **Recon:** Infrastructure mapping.
- **Analyst:** Logic & CVE matching.
- **Planner:** Strategy & Game theory.
- **Reporter:** Human-readable audits.
- **OSINT:** Global web intelligence.

## 🛡️ The Future of Security on Solana
As autonomous agents gain financial sovereignty (via Molt.id), they require built-in security layers to protect their assets and their mission. Pi is the first swarm built specifically for this intersection.

*Stay sovereign. Stay secure.*
